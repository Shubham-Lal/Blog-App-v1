**SETUP**
1) Create a `.env` file in the `config` folder & also in `admin/config` folder.
2) Add these environment variables into these `.env` files:
```
ROOT_URL=
DB_HOST=
DB_USER=
DB_PASS=
DB_NAME=
```
3) Install `composer` globally & in the terminal, navigate to your project folder and run `composer install` command. This will install `vlucas/phpdotenv` in the root of the project folder.
